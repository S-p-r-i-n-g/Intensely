# Prompts Directory

This directory contains individual text files for each exercise prompt.

## Structure

Each file is named `{slug}.txt` and contains the motion prompt for that exercise.

```
push-up.txt      → "A person performing push-up..."
squat.txt        → "A person performing squat..."
burpee.txt       → "A person performing burpee..."
```

## Usage

**Generated by:** `src/02_prepare_batch.py`

**Purpose:** These files are uploaded to cloud GPU for batch motion generation with HY-Motion 1.0

**Batch Processing Workflow:**

1. **Prepare batch:**
   ```bash
   python src/02_prepare_batch.py
   ```

2. **Upload to cloud GPU:**
   ```bash
   rsync -avz prompts/ user@runpod:/workspace/prompts/
   ```

3. **Run HY-Motion batch:**
   ```bash
   # On RunPod GPU
   python batch_process.py --input prompts/ --output motion_data/
   ```

4. **Download results:**
   ```bash
   rsync -avz user@runpod:/workspace/motion_data/ motion_data/
   ```

## File Format

Each `.txt` file contains:
- A single line of text
- 15-55 words (typically 40-50 after enrichment)
- Starts with "A person"
- Biomechanical description of the exercise

## Metadata

See `manifest.json` in the project root for complete metadata including:
