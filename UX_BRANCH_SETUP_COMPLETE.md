# ✅ UX Branch Setup Complete!

Your project is now set up with a separate branch for UX improvements. Here's what was done:

## What's Been Set Up

### ✅ Git Repository
- **Main branch**: Contains your stable, working code
- **Feature branch**: `feature/ux-improvements` - For all UX work

### ✅ Documentation Created
1. **UX_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive UX strategy (599 lines)
2. **UX_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick implementation guide with wireframes
3. **UX_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md** - Track your progress as you implement
4. **BRANCH_WORKFLOW.md** - Guide for working with branches
5. **design-tokens.ts** - Ready-to-use design system code

### ✅ Initial Commit
- UX documentation and design tokens committed to `feature/ux-improvements` branch
- Your main project code is on `main` branch

---

## Quick Start

### You're Currently On:
```bash
feature/ux-improvements
```

### To Start Working:
1. **You're already on the UX branch!** ✅
2. Start implementing improvements from `UX_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`
3. Commit your changes as you go

### To Switch Back to Main:
```bash
git checkout main
```

### To Switch Back to UX Work:
```bash
git checkout feature/ux-improvements
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Review the Plan
Read through `UX_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` to understand the full strategy.

### 2. Start with Phase 1
Begin with the foundation items in `UX_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`:
- [ ] Import design tokens into your components
- [ ] Create reusable Button component
- [ ] Create reusable Card component
- [ ] Enhance Home Screen

### 3. Track Your Progress
Update `UX_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` as you complete items.

### 4. Commit Often
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(ux): [what you did]"
```

✅ **Easy to merge** - When ready, merge UX branch back to main  
✅ **Track progress** - Use the tracker to see what's done
