## Objective Mapping to Exercise Taxonomy

### Exercise Selection Algorithm

**For each objective, score exercises:**

```javascript
function scoreExerciseForObjective(exercise, objective) {
  let score = 0;

  // Category matching
  if (objective.preferredCategories.high.includes(exercise.category)) {
    score += 10;
  } else if (objective.preferredCategories.medium.includes(exercise.category)) {
    score += 5;
  }

  // Tag matching
  if (objective === 'Fat Burn' && exercise.tags.cardio_intensive) {
    score += 8;
  }

  if (objective === 'Strength Building' && exercise.difficulty === 'advanced') {
    score += 7;
  }

  // Difficulty match
  if (exercise.difficulty === userLevel) {
    score += 5;
  }

  return score;
}
```
